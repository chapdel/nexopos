#   Settings API
The settings API allows you to create ready to use form to save quickly settings on the `nexopos_options` table. 
This guide define how you can register settings and use them.

## Prior Consideration Regarding Menu
The settings API doesn't create settings menu on the dashboard sidebar. This should be made by the end developper using the [Menu API](/readme/php/MenuAPI.md).

## Initialize A Settings Page
A Settings page must be initialized as a class that inherite from the `App\Services\SettingsPage` class. This is a concrete example on how it's registered.

```php
App\Settings;

use App\Services\SettingsPage;
use App\Services\Options;

class MySettings extends SettingsPage
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        // required to populate the form.
        $options        =   app()->make( Options::class );
        
        $this->form     =   [
            'tabs'      =>  [
                'general'   =>  [
                    'label' =>  __( 'General Settings' ),
                    'fields'    =>  [
                        [
                            'label' =>  __( 'Store Name' ),
                            'name'  =>  'ns_store_name',
                            'value' =>  $options->get( 'ns_store_name' ),
                            'description'   =>  __( 'Provide the store name here.' ),
                            'validation'    =>  'required'
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    }    
}
```

The class has a protected property named `form` which is requried as this hold the form definition. The settings page consist of tabs that has fields. 
A settings page can have 1 or multple settings page (up to 8). Each fields but be prefixed with a unique expression. Every Labsdel fields are prefixed with `ns_`.

Regarding the field validation, you can use [Laravel Validation rules](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/validation), and during the submission, the data will be validated.

**Note:** During the submission, the data submitted to the server consist of a multidimensionnal object. Every fields are contained within tabs identifier. 
In our above example, here is the JSON object submitted to the server.

```json
{
    "general": {
        "ns_store_name": ""
    }
}
```

The following JSON is generated using the JavaScript FormValidation class.

## Register A Settings Page
Every settings page must be registered to be properly initialized. By default, all registration are made on the `App\Providers\SettingsPageProvider`, on the boot `method`. Here is concretely how it's made :

```php
    /**
     * Bootstrap services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        Hook::addFilter( 'ns.settings', function( $class, $identifier ) {
            switch( $identifier ) {
                case 'ns.general': return new GeneralSettings; break;
                case 'ns.pos': return new PosSettings; break;
                case 'ns.customers': return new CustomersSettings; break;
                case 'ns.supplies-deliveries': return new SuppliesDeliveriesSettings; break;
                case 'ns.orders': return new OrdersSettings; break;
                case 'ns.stores': return new StoresSettings; break;
                case 'ns.service-providers': return new ServiceProvidersSettings; break;
                case 'ns.invoice-settings': return new InvoiceSettings; break;
            }
            return $class;
        }, 10, 2 );
    }
```
It's important to remind you that each Settings pages must have a unique identifier. As fields, this help the system to locate the right Settings to load. 
Labsdel settings page identifier starts with 'ns.'. 

If you look closer at the above code, you'll see a Hook (filter), on the identifier 'ns.settings'. This should be useful to help you extending the declared settings right from your custom module without touching the source code.

## Display A Settings Page
We'll need to use the provided `<ns-settings/>` vue component to render our generated settings page. The work principle is actually simple : you provide a link to the component, and it will loads the form definition from the server and render the form, just as you've defined that. You won't need to create about data validation or saving as it's handled by the system already.

```blade
<ns-settings url="{{ url( 'api/nexopos/v4/settings/ns.general' ) }}"></ns-settings>
```
Here the identifier `ns.general` is a system registered settings page. Using the same identifier will overwrite system general settings.
