Most of the components available on Labsdel 1.x are Vue.js components. If for some reason, you would like to inject a custom fields, you need to understand how fields are created.
First of all, default fields are automatically loaded within every main Vue instances, however you can't register your component the same way as that will involve editing the source code.
The work around to do this is first to edit the signature of the fields from the backend and from the frontend to create a Vue component that will automatically be rendered.

## Modifiy Backend Signature
By modifying the signature we mean being able to change the fields provided by default. For more forms, Labsdel 1.x perform an asynchronous request to the server to get
fields signature and thefore load the form accordingly. Any custom field should be referenced there as well. While defining your custom field you can use the following types : 

- text
- textarea
- password
- email
- number
- media (opens the media library)
- custom (let you define the shape of your field)

We'll then register a filter that will overwrite the login page fields :

```php
use App\Services\Hook;

// ...
  Hook::addFilter( 'ns-login-fields', function( $fields ) {
    $fields[]   = [
      'type'  =>  'custom',
      'name'  =>  'myCustomField', // <= pay attention to the case sensitiveness of this property.
    ];
    
    return $fields;
  });
```

## Render Your Component

While for most of the listed type there is an accurate use-case and render similarily throughout the application, for `custom` it's important to explain how it work.

Not every field might use Labsdel 1.x default styling and features. This type let you dynamically load a vue component within Labsdel 1.x Vue instances. 
This is possible thanks to the javascript object named : `nsExtraComponents`. 

This is the object where you must define your custom field component. Let's create a custom click counter component : 

```js
nsExtraComponents.myCustomField   = Vue.component( 'myCustomField', {
  template: `<button v-model="counter" @click="counter++">{{ counter }}</button>`,
  data() {
      return {
        counter : 0
      }
  }
});
```

You should note that the property we set to `nsExtraComponents` is named exactly as the value we've set on the fields signature : "myCustomField". It's important to keep it
that was as Labsdel 1.x will fetch from `nsExtraComponents` to see if any component has been registered in order to render the field. If it's not correcly defined, nothing will render.

## About Parameters and Event

While the component is rendered, the "field" signature is passed as `field` property to the custom field component. That signatures includes if it's provided from the signature :

- the field label
- the field name
- the field description
- the field validation

And some other attributes automatically added while rendering the component.
As this component should behave as any regular fields, @change and @blur events are expected to be dispatched from the field. Typically here is how your custom input component might looks like.

```js
nsExtraComponents.myCustomInput   = Vue.component( 'myCustomInput', {
  template: `<input v-model="field.value" @change="$emit( 'change', field }" @blur="$emit( 'blur', field )"/>`,
  props: [ 'field' ]
});

```
*We assume here `myCustomInput` is correctly defined on the field signature*.
